# Capstone Project: Predicting Wide Receivers Performance in the NFL

### Quick Summary

The best college football athletes get a chance to be selected by professional teams during the annual NFL draft. Wide Receivers (WR's) are no exceptions, and each General Manager (GM) establishes a ranking of the players available to fill for the team's needs at this position. A substantial amount of WR's end up performing poorly in the league, while others exceed at their position.

But what do we mean by **performance**? For a WR, the number of receiving yards throughout a season is critical to the success of the player and the team. For a GM, it is important to know the expected performances throughout the first contract (roughly the first 5 years in the league after being drafted). Hence, the original objective was to produce a quantitative analysis of the WR's performances entering the NFL and to design a model that predicts the playersâ€™ expected **receiving yards during their first 5 years**, based on their collegiate and NFL combine achievements. The players drafted between 2000 and 2011 served as data points to train the model.

However, because the data was limited (only 393 rows), incomplete (75% of those being complete), and heavily zero-inflated, the first model produced unsatisfactory levels of predictions. I then decided to turn this project into a classification one, where the algorithm predicts the **chance of success in the league**, a proability that the receiving yards exceed a certain threshold. This method was far more successful: the model was 80% accurate and was used against the 2020 class to rank the WR's that were going to be drafted this year.

### Organization of the Directory

For more information about the project itself, check out the sub-repository "reports". There are slides (slides.pptx) along with a final report which covers the motivations behind this capstone project, our methodology, the data wrangling steps, the statistical tests we used to analyse our data and the development of a machine learning based predictive algorithm.

You can also check the notebooks in this repository. Each is specifically oriented toward a goal and contains a thorough describtion of the methodology used to collect, clean, verify and test the data. Chronologically speaking, one should read the notebooks in this order:

- Collecting_Data_TableDraft.ipynb: scrape the pro-football-reference website and collects draft, NFL and CFB data
- Collecting_Data_TableCombine.ipynb: collects NFL combine data
- Collecting_Data_Final.ipynb: merge NFL, CFB, Combine data in a single csv file
- Cleaning_Data.ipynb: cleans our data and exports a usuable csv file
- Exploratory_Data.ipynb: runs basic inferential statistics, generates even more data and explore trends
- Statistical_Data_Analysis.ipynb: runs advanced inferential statistics on data
- Machine_Learning_Model (1) and (2): build two predictive models. The first one produced unsatisfactory predictions with regard to our target (the number of receiving yards during the first 5 years in the NFL) and was based solely on a linear regression method. The second is a classifier which instead predicts the chance of a player being successful in the league, a model which turns out to be far more profitable and reliable.

Some of these notebooks come with a respective module file (filename.py) where we define each of the user-defined functions that we use in the corresponding notebook.
