For now, feel free to check the two notebooks Collecting_Data_Final.ipynb and Collecting_Data_TableDraft.ipynb. Each contains a thorough describtion of the methodology used to collect, clean and verify the data. Additionally, useful comments supplement important results throughout each notebook.
I would also recommend to check out the user-defined functions defined in each of the respective modules (filename_Functions.py).
