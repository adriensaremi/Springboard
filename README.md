# Springboard
In this directory, you will find all content from the Springboard assignments, a online data science education platform that trains data scientists to face most of the challenges faced in the data science business world. The exercises are various, and are in the form of:
- mini-projects: each one covering a specific topic of data science.
- capstone projects (two of them)

There capstone assignments are done under the supervision of Lucas Allen, my mentor at Springboard. They are data science projects done from start to finish and they include: 
- collecting datasets,
- cleaning, organizing, and visualizing the data, 
- perform statistical analysis,
- and building predictive models. 
I recommend to open each corresponding sub-directory to know more about the objective and the methodology used for each project.
